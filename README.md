- **`master.html`**: A base template that acts as the foundation for other templates, including common elements like headers and footers.
- **`pay.html`**: Template for handling payment-related interactions (e.g., purchasing items).
- **`products.html`**: Displays a list of available products.
- **`register.html`**: Template for user registration.
